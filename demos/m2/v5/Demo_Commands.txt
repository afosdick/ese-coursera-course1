Below are the instructions use for the C1M2V5 Demo

GCC is used in the following way on the command line
  $ gcc [OPTIONS] [FILE-TO-COMPILE]

=============================================================================

  Native Compiler Example Commands

=============================================================================
This will compile and link. Also specifies the output file to store as the
executable file (using the -o <FILE> option. All warnings will be treated as
errors and use the c99 c-standard.
  $ gcc -std=c99 -Werror - main.c

This will compile and stop before link (-c option). All warnings will be
enabled, use the c89 C-standard. Also use the -v verbose option to print lots
of information of what gcc is doing to the terminal.
  $ gcc -std=c89 -Wall -v -c main.c

To compile in a linker file with the ARM cross compiler and generate a map file
  $ arm-none-eabi-gcc -o main.out main.c my_file.c -Wl,-T msp432p401r.lds -Wl,-Map=main.map --specs=nosys.specs
